# Keys Store

The **Expo Open OTA** server requires several keys and secrets to interact with the Expo API and your CDN.

The **Key store** is a module that manages how these keys are accessed by the server.

You can use 3 different key stores:
1. **Local Key Store**: Keys are stored in a directory on the server as *.pem files.
2. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Keys are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and securely accessed by the server.
3. **Environment Variables**: Keys are stored as environment variables in base64 format.

:::note
The environment variables required for key store configuration are listed below. You can set them in a `.env` file in the root of the project or keep them in a safe place to prepare for deployment.
:::

## Keys

The following keys are used by the server:
1. **Expo signing key pairs**: Used to sign and verify the updates returned by the server to `expo-updates`. The key pair consists of a public and private key and are **required** by the server.
2. **Cloudfront private key**: Used to sign the Cloudfront URLs for the assets. This key is **optional** and only required if you are using Cloudfront as your CDN.

## Expo signing certificate

To generate expo signing key pairs :
1. On your terminal, go to the root directory of your expo project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
npx eoas generate-certs
```

Three files will be generated in the `certs` directory:
1. `private-key.pem`: The private key used to sign the updates.
2. `public-key.pem`: The public key used to verify the updates.
Those two keys are used by the server to sign and verify the updates.

3. `certificate.pem`: Used by your expo client to verify the updates. It should be committed to your expo project.

## Cloudfront private key

:::note
This key is only required if you are using Cloudfront as your CDN.
:::
Please refer to this [section](/docs/cdn#cloudfront) on how to generate a Cloudfront private key.

## Key Store Configuration

### Environment Variables

You will have to encode the keys in base64 format and set the following environment variables:

```bash
echo -n "your-private-key" | base64
```

Then set the following environment variables:

```bash
KEYS_STORAGE_TYPE=environment
PUBLIC_EXPO_KEY_B64=base64-encoded-public-key
PRIVATE_EXPO_KEY_B64=base64-encoded-private-key
PRIVATE_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_B64=base64-encoded-cloudfront-private-key
```

### AWS Secrets Manager

:::note
If you are not familiar with AWS Secrets Manager, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html).
:::

1. Create a secret for each keys in AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
KEYS_STORAGE_TYPE=aws-secrets-manager
AWS_KEYS_PRIVATE_EXPO_KEY_SECRET_ID=The secret name of the expo private key
AWS_KEYS_PUBLIC_EXPO_KEY_SECRET_ID=The secret name of the expo public key
AWS_KEYS_PRIVATE_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_SECRET_ID=The secret name of the cloudfront private key
AWS_REGION=your-region
```

If your are not using AWS IAM roles, you also need to set the following environment variables:
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
```

:::info
    The server use the same AWS credentials for [S3 Storage](/docs/storage#amazon-s3) and AWS Secrets Manager. Please ensure to setup the correct ACLs and permissions for the keys.
:::

### Local Key Store

:::warning
This key store is not recommended for production use. It is intended for development and testing purposes only.
:::

To use local key store you will need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
KEYS_STORAGE_TYPE=local
PUBLIC_LOCAL_EXPO_KEY_PATH=/path/to/public-key.pem
PRIVATE_LOCAL_EXPO_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private-key.pem
PRIVATE_LOCAL_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PATH=/path/to/cloudfront-private-key.pem
```
