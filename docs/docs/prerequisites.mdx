# Prerequisites

To get started with **Expo Open OTA**, you need to review the following prerequisites:

:::note
Some of the environment variables required for the server are listed below. You can set them in a `.env` file in the root of the project or keep them in a safe place to prepare for deployment.

## Expo Token & Project ID

To interact with the Expo API, you need an **Expo token** and **project ID**. These credentials authenticate update publishing
and allow the server to fetch the release channel-to-branch mappings.

### How to Get Your Expo Token

1. Go to the [Access tokens page](https://expo.dev/settings/access-tokens) on your expo dashboard.
2. Click on the **+ Create token** button.
3. Enter a name for your token and click **Create**.
4. Copy the generated token and store it in a safe place.

:::info
This token will be used as the `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

### How to Get Your Project ID

#### From EAS CLI

1. Ensure you have the [EAS CLI](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli) installed.
2. Ensure you are logged in to your Expo account by running

    ```bash
    eas account:view
    ```
3. On your terminal go to the root directory of your Expo project.
4. Run

    ```bash
    eas project:info
    ```
   to get the project ID.

#### From Expo Dashboard

1. Login to your [Expo dashboard](https://expo.dev).
2. Go to the **Projects page**
3. Click on the project you want to get the ID for.
4. The project ID is displayed on the top of the page.

:::info
This ID will be used as the `EXPO_APP_ID` environment variable.

## JWT Secret

A JWT Secret can be used to sign and verify some of the requests made to the server. This secret is used to sign the JWT token
that is sent to the client when they request an update manifest.
To generate a JWT secret, you can use the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

:::info
This secret will be used as the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable.

## Base URL

The base URL is the URL where your server will be hosted. This URL is used to generate the URLs for the assets that are sent to the client.
Example: `https://my-ota-server.com`

:::info
This URL will be used as the `BASE_URL` environment variable.
